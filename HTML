                <div class="dest-text">
                    One of my favorite cities in the world is Paris. I have always been drawn to the 
                    city's rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture. There's something
                     about walking along the Seine River, admiring the beautiful Notre-Dame Cathedral, 
                     and strolling through the charming streets lined with cafes and boutiques that makes
                      me feel alive. Every time I visit Paris, I feel as though I am transported to a 
                      different time and place. I also love the art and food scene in Paris, as well as 
                      the friendly locals who are always eager to share their culture with visitors. Overall, 
                      Paris holds a special place in my heart and I hope to continue to visit this amazing 
                      city for years to come.

                <h3>New York City</h3>
                <img src="Image/New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg"/>
                <div class="dest-text">
                    There's just something about the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple that ignites my passion
                     and makes me feel alive. The energy is electric, the diversity is unparalleled, and the 
                     opportunities are endless. From the iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and the 
                     Empire State Building to the vibrant cultural scenes in neighborhoods like Brooklyn and
                      Harlem, New York has something for everyone. I love exploring the city's art galleries, 
                      trying new foods in its countless restaurants, and getting lost in the chaos of Times Square. 
                      It's a city that never sleeps, and neither do I when I'm there. To me, New York represents 
                      the epitome of possibility and a place where dreams can come true.
